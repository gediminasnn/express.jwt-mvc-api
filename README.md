# JWT MVC API - JWT Token Generation API

JWT MVC API is a TypeScript-based application using the Express.js framework, designed with a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It provides a RESTful API that includes JWT token generation and user management, serving as a foundation for further development.

The application generates and signs JWT tokens using RSA256, allowing the validation of tokens via public endpoints. This functionality is ideal for demonstrating backend concepts, such as token-based authentication.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system before setting up the project:

- **Node.js & npm**: Verify installation with `node -v` and `npm -v`. If not installed, download from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:gediminasnn/express.jwt-mvc-api.git
   ```
   Replace the URL with your repository URL if needed.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   
   Change to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd jwt-mvc-api
   ```

3. **Prepare the Environment File**
   
   Copy the provided `env.example` file to a new `.env` file and customize it if necessary:
   
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   Ensure you add the RSA256 private and public keys generated using [https://mkjwk.org/](https://mkjwk.org/) to the `.env` file.

4. **Run the Application**
   
   Use npm to start the application:
   
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command will start the application in development mode.

## API Documentation

The JWT MVC API application provides the following RESTful API endpoints for JWT token generation:

### 1. Generate JWT Token

**Request:**
```http
GET /jwt/token
```

**Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMTIzIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNjgwMDAwMDAwfQ..."
}
```

This endpoint generates a JWT token signed using the private key. The payload is static but can be modified as needed.

### 2. Get Public Key

**Request:**
```http
GET /jwt/public-key
```

**Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "kty": "RSA",
    "e": "AQAB",
    "n": "...",
    "alg": "RS256",
    "use": "sig"
}
```

This endpoint returns the public key in JWK format for validating JWT tokens generated by the `/jwt/token` endpoint.

## Notes

- Use environment variables to store private keys securely.
- The JWT token generated should be valid and can be verified using the `/jwt/public-key` endpoint.
- You can test token validation directly using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).
